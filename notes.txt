This project was inspired by and is a replica of Omid Ghavami's (https://github.com/odyssjii/tetris/tree/master/src) video on tetris game - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh3rkt6nZ2c&ab_channel=InvertedMinds

Design Notes:

SDL screen window width = 420 pixels
SDL screen window height = 700 pixels
Chosen grid size = 30 pixels
Width of game board = 420 / 30 = 14
Height of game board = 700 / 30 = 23.33 but chose 22
Visible height = 20

To spawn a piece and check for game over, two rows from the height were left out. So, the visible height is 20 while the total height is 22

Choice of Programming Style -
I chose functional programming as it was simple and direct for this game.

Graphics library -
Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL2)
For installation instructions, visit https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation

Information displayed on game screen -
Current level
Score
Lines filled

Generated tetrino pieces using a structure and rgba array. Refer tetrinos.h (put link)

Game engine -
A switch statement which switches between four phases of the game with each phase having its own update function that implements the corresponding algorithm. The four phases:
(i) GAME_PHASE_START
(ii) GAME_PHASE_PLAY
(iii) GAME_PHASE_LINE
(iv) GAME_PHASE_GAMEOVER

Information about the game level is taken from Nintendo Tetris's wiki page

Information about the scoring system is taken from Nintendo Tetris's wiki page

Information about switching to next level is taken from Nintendo Tetris's wiki page

Issues:
1.) I was stuck for more than an hour with sdl2 linker error. The issue was resolved thanks to the solution by zeroc8 in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18449697/sdl2-undefined-references-to-functions 

2.) Similarly for TTL visit https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36434663/sdl-ttf-undefined-reference-to-ttf-init
